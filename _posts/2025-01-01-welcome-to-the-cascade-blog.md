We are opening up the Cascade blog to share progress on our inference research, product milestones, and the messy journaling that happens in between.<!--more--> Expect a mix of deep technical dives, ruminations on product philosophy, and the occasional rant about why we build things the way we do.

Over the coming months we will use this space to:

- Document how "flow prompting" evolves from a concept into production-grade tooling.
- Share practical notes from shipping custom generative AI deployments for clients.
- Highlight partner work that deserves more attention than a fleeting social post.

If you would like to react or ask questions somewhere public, we keep an eye on the discussion threads linked above. Prefer email? As always, write to [hello@cascadetech.ai](mailto:hello@cascadetech.ai).

Talk soon.
