    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>The year is 2025 and the world is faced with a confounding duality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generative AI is a broken, frustrating and hollow simulacrum of what it is often sold to be.</li>
        <li>Nearly every company on earth should be trying to figure out how they can integrate gen AI into their business.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cascade Technologies was founded to address both of these needs.</p>
    <p>To address the second issue, we provide expert advice and assistance as to how generative AI can be used today to improve your business. And how it can't.</p>
    <p>To address the first issue, we are building tools to harness this technology and allow you to focus its strengths, and sand down some of the burrs of its weaknesses.</p>

    <h1>NEXT GEN AI INFERENCE</h1>
    <p>Cascade Technologies is building a revolutionary new LLM inference platform. The era of the dominant LLM inference modality introduced by OpenAI has proven more long lasting than expected. But in reality it is anachronistic, limiting, and ultimately only constricts the promise of these marvelous machines.</p>
    <p>At their core, LLMs are a dynamic, elegant, and even poetic guide through the probability space of human thought. Contemporary LLM inference modalities are such a tragic constriction of this potential! LLM inference APIs up to this point have taken the form of a message in a bottle, drifting back and forth across a lonely sea between human and machine intelligence.</p>
    <p>'Flow prompting' is an attempt to bridge that ocean, to make human-LLM correspondence less of a transaction and more of a dance, or at least more of a real conversation. A good conversation doesn't have the rigid structure of a protocol, it is a constant flow of information and ideas between two parties, each reacting to the ideas of the other.  Flow Prompting helps make llm inference more of a conversation and less of a protocol.</p>
    <p>You'll have to forgive the obtuse metaphors for the moment. Code will follow soon, but for the moment, maybe reflect on what you think those ideas might look like if you were asked to implement them!</p>
